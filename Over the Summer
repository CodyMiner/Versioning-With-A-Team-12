Over the summer I took two classes, and worked two jobs.  I got married; that was pretty great.  I also took a trip to Bloomington to visit some old friends.  Not a bad summer!

Over the summer I spent the majority of my time working and attempting to stay sane. I got the chance to take a trip to Pennsylvania to visit my girlfriend's family and go hiking through the mountains.

Over the summer I worked at a winery full time as soon as the spring semester ended. Unfortunately I worked so much that I was unable to travel as much as I would have liked to but the overtime pay was worth it!
