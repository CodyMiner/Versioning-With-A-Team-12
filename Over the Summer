Over the summer I took two classes, and worked two jobs.  I got married; that was pretty great.  I also took a trip to Bloomington to visit some old friends.  Not a bad summer!

Over the summer I spent the majority of my time working and attempting to stay sane. I got the chance to take a trip to Pennsylvania to visit my girlfriend's family and go hiking through the mountains.
